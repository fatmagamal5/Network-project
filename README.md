ðŸ“˜ Project Overview The project focuses on designing, implementing, and configuring a complex enterprise network with full functionality, security, and management features. It aims to simulate a real-world scenario, including subnetting, routing, VLANs, DHCP, NAT, VPN, wireless access, and full documentation.

âœ… Project Objectives VLSM Design â€“ Design and implement a subnetting scheme using 10.0.0.0/8

Network Setup â€“ Configure interfaces, device settings, and IP addressing

Layer 2 Configuration â€“ VLANs, trunking, inter-VLAN routing, EtherChannel

Routing Protocols â€“ Implement OSPFv2, EIGRP, and route redistribution

DHCP Configuration â€“ Set up centralized and remote DHCP servers

NAT â€“ Implement both dynamic (PAT) and static NAT

Network Management â€“ NTP, Syslog, DNS, Web & Mail servers

IPsec VPN â€“ Secure connectivity between remote sites via site-to-site VPN

Wireless Configuration â€“ Deploy a wireless home router with secure access

Connectivity Testing â€“ Full network ping, traceroute, routing table validation

Documentation â€“ Comprehensive guide with screenshots, configs, and test cases

ðŸ§° Technologies & Tools Cisco Packet Tracer

IPv4 Subnetting (VLSM)

OSPFv2 & EIGRP Routing

DHCP, NAT, VLANs

Syslog, NTP, DNS, Email/Web Servers

Site-to-Site IPsec VPN

Wireless Router Configuration

Linux CLI & Network Utilities

ðŸ“‚ Structure /configs/ â€“ Router and switch configuration files

/diagrams/ â€“ Network topologies and addressing schemes

/documentation/ â€“ Final report with testing and verification

/screenshots/ â€“ Ping tests, interface status, and routing tables

/dhcp-nat-vpn/ â€“ DHCP pools, NAT settings, VPN configs

ðŸ“Ž Notes All IP addresses, VLAN IDs, and routing protocols are configured according to project specifications.

The DHCP and static configurations ensure hosts can access the network reliably.

Dynamic routing and route redistribution allow seamless integration of different protocols.

A site-to-site VPN secures communication between MIU and its branch network.
